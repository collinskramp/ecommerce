# Frontend Public Assets

This directory contains public assets for the frontend application.

## Images

Currently using SVG placeholders. Replace these with actual images:

- `images/logo.png` - Main logo (recommend: 200x200px PNG)
- `images/language.png` - Language selector icon (50x50px PNG)
- `images/banner/shop.png` - Shop banner (1200x400px PNG/JPG)

## How to Replace Placeholders

1. Save your actual images with the same filenames
2. Recommended formats: PNG for logos/icons, JPG for banners
3. Optimize images before uploading for better performance

## Notes

- SVG placeholders are temporary and render as basic shapes
- For production, use optimized images
- Consider using a CDN for better performance
